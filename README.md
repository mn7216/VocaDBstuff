# Vocalost Utils:

This Userscript aims to make the process of identifying, searching for, and archiving a lost song easier. It makes common ways of finding a song much faster as you can simply use the menu's functions rather than manually going through the process of, for example, copy-pasting a song's id into Nicolog and trying to find it.

### Currently, it has a total of 20 functions, 5 for [User Pages](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki/User-Page) and 15 for [Video Pages](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki/Video-Pages). You can view the list of functions and what they do by clicking on the links or going to the [wiki](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki).

As of 1.1, a [companion script for translating Nicolog](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki#nicolog-translation-helper) is available. 

As of 1.3, a [companion script for downloading locked Piapro songs is available](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki#Piapro-DL) is available. 

# Installation:

Install a userscript manager such as [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/), [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

# Roadmap / Things I hope to implement in the future
- [x] Inital Release
- [ ] Have script reference database of all vocaranks that provide ids in their description (in progress)
- [ ] Have script reference database of ALL vocaranks
- [ ] Ability to search by song's name instead of ID (useful for finding reprints that don't include nnd id, i.e. the majority.)
