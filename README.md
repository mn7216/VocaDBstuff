# Vocalost Utils:

This Userscript aims to provide general-use tools to aid users in adding certain videos (namely deleted ones) to VocaDB. It integrates common ways of finding a song, making the process much faster than doing them manually.

### Currently, it has a total of 20 functions, 5 for [User Pages](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki/User-Page) and 15 for [Video Pages](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki/Video-Pages). You can view the list of functions and what they do by clicking on the links or going to the [wiki](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki).

As of 1.1, a [companion script for translating Nicolog](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki#nicolog-translation-helper) is available. 

As of 1.3, a [companion script for downloading locked Piapro songs is available](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki#Piapro-DL) is available.
