# Vocalost Utils:

This Userscript aims to make the process of identifying, searching for, and archiving a lost song easier. It makes common ways of finding a song much faster as you can simply use the menu's functions rather than manually going through the process of, for example, copy-pasting a song's id into Nicolog and trying to find it.

### Currently, it has a total of 18 functions, 5 for [User Pages](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki/User-Page) and 13 for [Video Pages](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki/Video-Pages). You can view the list of functions and what they do by clicking on the links or going to the [wiki](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki).

As of 1.1, a [companion script for translating Nicolog](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/wiki#nicolog-translation-helper) is available. 

# Installation:

Install a userscript manager such as [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/), [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

[Click here to install the script.](https://github.com/mn7216/Vocalost/raw/main/vocalostutils.user.js)

The script should now be installed!

# Usage:

This script functions on NicoNico video pages and user pages (pages starting with https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/ and https://www.nicovideo.jp/user/). On these pages, a menu tab should appear on the center right of the page:
